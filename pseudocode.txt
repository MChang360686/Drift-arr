To find ultimate_parent_id, I would
1. check current account id in accounts.csv
2. check parent column
3. If parent is empty then this is the ultimate_parent
4. Otherwise, check the parent of the first account
5. Repeat until parent column is empty

check dataframe
if parent is empty
    Finish
else
    while don't know parent
        check dict 1 for parent account
        get value of parent account
        if value is empty
            know parent
            Finish


To find arr I would
1. Get account_id
2. check dict 2 and 3
2. match subscription_id to money owed by that specific account

check dataframe
get account_id
match account_id to subscription_id in dict 2
check dict 3 for total money owed (precalculated into dict3)

To find hierarchy_arr I would
1. Using dictionary comprehension, check which values have 
the account in question as parent. (BFS?)
2. using for each on list, Append their money to the amount in arr
3. Check each item in list for more children
4. Nest the loops? (DFS?)

check dataframe for account_id
amt = arr
Use dictionary comprehension to make a list of all the children of the 
account in question
for item in list
    amt += moneyOwed(child)
    check if child has children 
    if more children 
        append children to list
